# Optimized Video Prompt for Vidu Q1

## Final Optimized Prompt
```
A beautiful calico cat with orange, white, and black patches sleeps peacefully curled up on white bedding. Golden warm sunlight streams through windows creating soft shadows. The cat's chest rises and falls gently with breathing. Occasional subtle ear twitches and slight tail movements. Camera slowly zooms in slightly on the sleeping cat. Serene morning atmosphere with natural lighting transitions.
