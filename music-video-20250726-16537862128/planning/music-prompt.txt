Create a short 35-second acoustic indie pop song with a female teenage vocalist performing a street performance. The song should feature gentle acoustic guitar strumming, soft percussion, and warm bass tones. Start with a tender 4-second intro, build to an emotional 16-second chorus with passionate vocals, then end with a peaceful 4-second outro. The melody should convey youth, dreams, and heartfelt emotions of a high school singer-songwriter. Keep the tempo at 100 BPM with a major key progression. Include subtle street ambiance and natural reverb to create an authentic outdoor performance atmosphere.
