A teenage Japanese high school girl with long brown hair, wearing a school uniform, sitting on a street corner during golden hour, playing acoustic guitar with prominent gentle strumming and singing passionately. Warm orange and yellow sunlight creates soft shadows. Urban street background with shops and pedestrians slightly blurred. Natural, candid expression showing youthful dreams and innocence. Cinematic composition, shallow depth of field, warm color palette, authentic street performance atmosphere, gentle lighting, emotional and inspiring mood with heartfelt sincerity.
