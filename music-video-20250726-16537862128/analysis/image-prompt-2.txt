A teenage Japanese high school girl with long brown hair, wearing a school uniform, performing dynamically on a street corner during golden hour, playing acoustic guitar with more rhythmic strumming and singing with emotional expression. Eyes closed or looking up with passionate youth energy. Hair slightly moving in gentle wind. Warm orange and yellow sunlight creates dramatic shadows. Urban street background with shops and pedestrians. Natural, heartfelt expression showing dreams and determination. Cinematic side angle composition, shallow depth of field, warm color palette, authentic street performance atmosphere with inspiring mood.
